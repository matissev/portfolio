		"text": "The production loss factors of a vineyard are many&#8239;: diseases, hydric stress, weatherâ€¦ Vino is a connected object allowing to observe the evolution of the plants in order to prevent the complications, while saving ressources. By combining multiple sensors, this little box gathers different informations about the vineyard (soil moisture, precipitation rate, luminosity, sap pressure, etc.) and then transmits it to the smartphone of the winegrower so as to notify him/her of the potential dangers that his/here crops might incur. The device is powered by a solar panel on the main box and the informations are transmitted by bluetooth 4.0 (LE) once the stored energy is sufficient and the smartphone is nearby. If multiple devices are installed in the vineyard you can compare the evolution of the various vineyard plots."
