		"text": "Original and immersive, Feed Me Crystals is a game in which the goal is to catch as much crystals as you can before the time runs out, while avoiding to loose them on the way. This project, done in duo and combining sound design and graphical environment includes a simple but fun gameplay, made above all to catch a good laugh. The game includes two characters who help each other against mean rats. The characters must activate a pump which makes the gearings turn and therefore make the crystals fall from the roof for them to be reachable, collectable. For the pump to work, the two players need to jump successively on the trays on both ends of it. Once collected, you will need to store these in a tank and fill it as quickly as possible. Obstacles are here to slow you down&#8239;:<br>&ndash;&nbsp;Enemy rats can steal crystals from you.<br>&ndash;&nbsp;Wagons roll on the rails and can hit you, making you loose your crystals (a bit like Sonic).<br>&ndash;&nbsp;The gearings in the ground turn in opposite ways and make you loose your reference points and so the control of your caracter.<br>&ndash;&nbsp;The water slows you down."
