		"text": "By groups of four and within two days, we had to program a Processing sketch, the programing langage allowing to generate evolving graphics. We had to choose between two subjects : The bug or the identity. We chose the identity and we started to build a program that would generate the identity card of a song. This program use a FFT algorithm (for Fast Fourier Transform) available in the “minim” library that can calculate the volume of each frequency band (In this case the basses, the mediums, the trebles, and the high trebles). These numbers are then used to create shapes of different dimensions depending the power of the frequency band involved. The circles correspond to the basses, the squares to the mediums, the triangles to the trebles and the lines to the high trebles."
