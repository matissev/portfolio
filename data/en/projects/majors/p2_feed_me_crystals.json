				"The game includes two characters who help each other against mean rats. The goal is to catch a defined amount of crystals without loosing them of course. For this purpose, the characters must activate a pump which makes the gearings turn and therefore make the crystals fall from the roof for them to be reachable, collectable. For the pump to work the two players need to jump successively on the trays on both ends of it.",
				"Once collected, you will need to store these in a tank and fill it as quickly as possible. Obstacles are here to slow you down :<br>- Enemy rats can steal crystals from you.<br>- Wagons roll on the rails and can hit you and make you loose your crystals (a bit like in Sonic).<br>- The gearings in the ground turn in opposite ways, and make you loose your reference points and so your caracter's control.<br>- The water slows you down."
